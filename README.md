# Flash web app with API call

This is a simple flashcard game that helps users learn French or Spanish using the 100 most commonly used words in French. The app makes use of a REST API to provide users with a new word to guess each time they play.
I used automatic translation to get the spanish one. Some words translation may not be so accurate.

I did this in order to practice: 
* SQL databases
* Flask application
* Python
* REST API
* Cypress
* HTML/CSS
* Docker

## TODO
* Create a Docker compose and run the app on `gunicorn` and `nginx` proxy

The response will be a JSON object that contains the word and its translation:
```json
