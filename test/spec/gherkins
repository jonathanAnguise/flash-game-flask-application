Feature: Use the flash card game

Scenario: As a User I can see the answer by hoovering the card
Given I'm on the web app
And I see the word to translate on the card
When I'm hoovering with the mouse the card
Then I can see the translation of the word


Scenario: As a User when I click on 'New Word!' button, the app shows me a new flash card
Given I'm on the web app
When I click on the button 'New Word!'
Then a new card is created and I can see new words
